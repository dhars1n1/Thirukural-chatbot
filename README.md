# Project: Integrating Pinecone and LLaMA 3 for Contextual Query Response

## Overview

This project integrates Pinecone for vector search with LLaMA 3 to provide contextual responses based on Thirukkural teachings. The system uses SentenceTransformer to encode user queries, queries Pinecone for relevant metadata, and generates responses using LLaMA 3.

## Features

- **Query Encoding:** Uses SentenceTransformer to convert user queries into vectors.
- **Vector Search:** Queries Pinecone to retrieve relevant metadata based on encoded vectors.
- **Contextual Responses:** Uses LLaMA 3 to generate empathetic responses based on Thirukkural couplets.
- **Tanglish Responses:** Provides responses in a Tanglish style, emulating a Tamil boy speaking on social media.
